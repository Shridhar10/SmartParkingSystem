# SmartParkingSystem
This code has been written for arduino platform to manage parking of cars automatically.
our solution for smart parking system is to use
 infrared sensors- for detection of parked cars and arrived cars near the gate.
servo motor- used to open and close the gates.
microcontroller - for processing data.

This solution is completely Independent of human interference. 
If car comes near the entrance gate and if there is availability of parking space then the car will be taken inside.
or else red light will be glown showing no space for parking
